These scripts will (hopefully) help you build static libraries
for rosbag for android.

The do_everything.sh script will call all the other scripts
sequentially, you just have to give it a prefix path:

 $ ./do_everything.sh ../workspace

You can also run each script individually, most of them have
a minimalistic help string to give you an idea of their parameters.

Good luck.
